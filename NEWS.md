# coresynth 0.1.0

First public release.

## Methods

- **SCM** (Abadie, Diamond & Hainmueller 2010): Synthetic Control Method with unified formula interface.
  Supports predictor variables via `pred()`, out-of-sample V selection (`v_selection = "oos"`),
  donor filtering (`donor_mspe_threshold`), penalised SCM (`lambda_pen`), and staggered adoption.
  Inference: MSPE ratio permutation test via `mspe_ratio_pval()`.
- **SDID** (Arkhangelsky et al. 2021): Synthetic Difference-in-Differences.
  Supports time-varying covariates (`covariates =`), sharp and staggered adoption.
  Inference: `sdid_inference()` with placebo / bootstrap / jackknife / jackknife_global.
- **GSC** (Xu 2017): Generalised Synthetic Control with interactive fixed effects.
  Supports time-varying covariates via the full EM algorithm, sharp and staggered adoption.
  Inference: parametric bootstrap (`gsc_boot()`) and non-parametric (`gsc_inference()`).
- **MC** (Athey et al. 2021): Matrix Completion via nuclear-norm regularisation (Soft-Impute).
  Supports sharp and staggered adoption.
- **TASC** (Rho et al. 2026): Time-Aware Synthetic Control via Kalman EM.
  Supports sharp and staggered adoption.
- **SI** (Agarwal et al. 2025): Synthetic Interventions via SI-PCR.
  Supports sharp, staggered, multi-arm (K > 1), and staggered × multi-arm.
  Inference: `si_inference()` with bootstrap / jackknife / jackknife_global.
- **SCM-Design** (Abadie & Zhao 2026): `scm_design()` with base / weakly_targeted / unit_level variants,
  blank-period permutation test, and split-conformal confidence intervals.

## Unified API

- Single `scm_fit(outcome ~ treatment | unit + time, data, method = ...)` entry point for all methods.
- `panel_to_tensor()` for multi-arm SI data preparation.
- `broom` integration: `tidy()`, `glance()`, `augment()` for all methods and inference objects.
- `plot.coresynth()`: trend, gap, and weights plots via ggplot2.
- `export_json()`: JSON export for reproducibility.

## Performance

All core optimisations implemented in C++ via RcppArmadillo:
50–70x faster than the **Synth** package for typical panel sizes (N_co ≤ 30).
`src/inference.cpp` placebo loops parallelised with OpenMP.
